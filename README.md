======
A simple programming language that creates basic pictures using the SDL graphics library.
The syntax is as follows:
* Line command draws a line from x,y to u,v: `line x y u v;`.
* Point command draws a single point at x,y: `point x y;`.
* Circle command draws a circle of radius r around the point x,y: `circle x y r;`.
* Rectangle command draws a rectangle of height h and width w beginning at the top left of x,y: `rectangle x y w h;`.
* Set color command changes current drawing color to the r,g,b tuple: `set_color r g b;`.
